These algorithms compare reviews made with the input as text and reviews made with an input as a jpg image.

In the files, you can find the output of different algorithm versions. The addition '10' means that the algorithm was run 10 times to gather more data.

In the gram_text_vs_photo.py file, you can find an algorithm that performs the grammatical review of the example file.

In the non-prom_text_vs_photo.py file, you can find an algorithm that performs the non-promotional review of the example file.

All of the needed things to run the algorithm are already inside each file.
