#### Sentence 1:

- **Deviation**: 
  - **According to [Source - Communicate With Care Pocket Guide]** the information suggests that the use of casual language like "like you're doing right now!" can be viewed as unprofessional and condescending. It violates Article 2.i. Maintain Professional Tone.

- **New Suggested Sentence**: "Starting these conversations can be challenging, but keeping your treatment goals in mind and educating yourself more about type 2 diabetes will help you communicate more effectively with your doctor about treatment."

#### Sentence 2:
- **Original Sentence**: "Your doctor is the medical expert, but you are the one living with type 2 diabetes."
- **Deviation**:
  - **According to [Source - Communicate With Care Pocket Guide]** the information suggests that the statement lacks context about the importance of the patient's role, violating Article 2.ii. Provide Context.
- **Expert Reviewer’s Suggested Change**: "While your doctor is the medical expert, it is essential to acknowledge that you, as a patient living with type 2 diabetes, understand your own body and experience."
- **Reason for New Suggested Change**: The expert reviewer’s revised sentence is effective but can be streamlined for readability and emphasis on shared decision-making.

#### Sentence 3:
- **Original Sentence**: "Discuss any difficulties you've experienced with your current treatment – such as side effects, if you would prefer a pill or an injection (if the option is available), if it fits into your lifestyle, if the cost is too high – and ask if there might be a better alternative that addresses these challenges."
- **Deviation**:
  - **According to [Source - Disclaimer Texts for Non-promotional Material]** the information suggests that suggesting treatment alternatives without a disclaimer might imply promotional intent, violating Article 3.iii. Stick to Facts.

  - **According to [Source - Global Legal & Compliance Pocket Guide Semaglutide portfolio]** the information suggests that suggesting switching without context can imply off-label promotion, violating Article 1.ii. Off-Label Information.
- **Expert Reviewer’s Suggested Change**: "Your doctor should have useful strategies to help you manage side effects or discuss if an alternative treatment might be appropriate."
- **Reason for New Suggested Change**: The expert reviewer’s change is effective, but the sentence can further avoid any implication of off-label promotion by focusing more on patient-doctor communication.
