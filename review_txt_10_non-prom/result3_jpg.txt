According to [EFPIA Chapter 3 - Article 16], LLH activities must have content that is fair, balanced, and objective to fulfill unmet educational needs in healthcare. 

The source sentence mentions that it is important to advocate for your needs and preferences during discussions with your healthcare provider. However, it does not emphasize the importance of ensuring balanced and objective communication as required by the EFPIA guidelines. 

New sentence: It is essential to advocate for your needs and preferences during discussions with your healthcare provider, ensuring that the information shared is fair, balanced, and objective to meet unmet educational needs in healthcare. This change addresses the deviation by highlighting the importance of adhering to guidelines for balanced and objective content in educational discussions.
