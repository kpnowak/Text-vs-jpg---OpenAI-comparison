Comment 1:
- Original source sentence: "Typically, type 2 diabetes patients should see their doctor every 3–6 months."
- Deviation from the guidelines: The existing sentence does not provide specific information regarding follow-up protocols and is not in alignment with the guidelines on engaging with healthcare professionals in a non-promotional manner.
- Expert reviewer's original suggested change: "As per non-promotional guidelines, it is recommended that individuals with type 2 diabetes schedule check-ups with their healthcare provider every 3–6 months to monitor the effectiveness of the new treatment."
- Explanation: The original suggestion lacks clarity in how the interaction should be framed within the non-promotional context. The guidelines emphasize the need for non-promotional, scientific healthcare interactions.
- New suggested sentence: "In line with non-promotional guidelines, individuals with type 2 diabetes are advised to arrange follow-up appointments every 3–6 months with their healthcare provider for monitoring the efficacy of the treatment."

- Deviation from the guidelines: The original sentence lacks clarity in defining the collaborative nature of interactions between patients and healthcare providers and does not reflect the requirements for non-promotional material engagement as outlined in the guidelines.
- Expert reviewer's original suggested change: "In accordance with non-promotional guidelines, the aim of this dialogue is to collaboratively identify the most suitable treatment option with your healthcare provider, focusing on your individual needs and preferences."
- Explanation: While the expert's suggested change is well-intentioned, it could be clearer in emphasizing the non-promotional aspect of the interaction, as per the guidelines.
- New suggested sentence: "Following non-promotional guidelines, the purpose of this discussion is to collaboratively explore the optimal treatment option with your healthcare provider, emphasizing your specific needs and preferences."
