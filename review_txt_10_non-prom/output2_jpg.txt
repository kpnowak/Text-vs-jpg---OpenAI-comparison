Expert Reviewer's Original Suggested Change:

Explanation of the Reason Behind New Suggested Change:
According to [EFPIA Chapter 4 - Article 21], it is essential that financial and non-financial support provided to patient organizations is acknowledged during interactions. The original statement emphasizes transparency but lacks the explicit mention of acknowledging support given. By enhancing the clarity on this aspect, the new suggested sentence aligns better with the guideline by ensuring that there is a clear acknowledgment of any support provided to patient organizations.
