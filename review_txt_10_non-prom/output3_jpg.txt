### Comment Review:

#### Comment 1:
- **Original Source Sentence:** According to [EFPIA Chapter 3 - Article 16], LLH activities must have content that is fair, balanced, and objective to fulfill unmet educational needs in healthcare. 
- **Deviation:** The source sentence mentions advocating for personal needs during healthcare provider discussions but overlooks emphasizing the importance of balanced and objective communication as required by the EFPIA guidelines.
- **Expert Reviewer's Suggested Change:** It is essential to advocate for your needs and preferences during discussions with your healthcare provider, ensuring that the information shared is fair, balanced, and objective to meet unmet educational needs in healthcare. 
- **Reasoning:** The expert reviewer's suggested change partially captures the need for balanced and objective communication but could be improved to directly address the deviation from emphasizing EFPIA guidelines. 
- **New Suggested Sentence:** During discussions with your healthcare provider, it is vital to ensure that the shared information adheres to the EFPIA guidelines, being fair, balanced, and objective to meet unmet educational needs in healthcare.
