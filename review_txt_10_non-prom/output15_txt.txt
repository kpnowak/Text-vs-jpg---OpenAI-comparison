### 2. Avoid Exaggerations and Maintain Factual Information

- **Original Source Sentence:**

- **Deviation from Guidelines:**
  According to [Source - Communicate With Care Pocket Guide - Article 2] the guide advises avoiding exaggerations and maintaining factual information. The phrase "like you're doing right now!" could be seen as speculative and unnecessary.

### 3. Use Polite Language and Maintain Professionalism

- **Original Source Sentence:**
  "Discuss any difficulties you've experienced with your current treatment—such as side effects, if you would prefer a pill or an injection (if the option is available), if it fits into your lifestyle, if the cost is too high—and ask if there might find a better alternative that addresses these challenges."

- **Deviation from Guidelines:**
  According to [Source - Communicate With Care Pocket Guide - Article 2] the guideline emphasizes using polite language and avoiding any phrase that may seem impolite. The phrase "if the cost is too high" could be perceived as informal and less professional.

- **Reason for New Suggested Change:**
  While the expert reviewer’s suggestion is closely aligned, it can be refined to ensure it thoroughly adheres to a polite and professional tone throughout.

- **New Suggested Sentence:**
  "Discuss any challenges you've encountered with your current treatment, such as side effects, preferences for administration method (pill or injection), lifestyle compatibility, or cost considerations, and ask about potential alternatives that could better address these concerns."

### 4. Ensure Clarity and Professional Tone

- **Original Source Sentence:**
  "Talk about your lifestyle and how a new treatment might be better suited for you. For example, if you travel a lot for work and are looking for a medication that is easy to take or maybe you don't have time to exercise as much as you would like, and you would prefer a treatment that can support your weight management goals (in addition to healthy eating and exercise)."

- **Deviation from Guidelines:**
  According to [Source - Communicate With Care Pocket Guide - Article 2] the guide emphasizes providing context to ensure clarity and avoid misunderstandings. The original sentence structure is somewhat disorganized and may lead to misunderstandings.

- **Expert Reviewer's Suggested Change:**
  "Describe your lifestyle and how a different treatment might better accommodate your needs. For instance, if you travel frequently for work and require a more convenient medication, or if limited time for exercise means you need a treatment that aids in weight management alongside healthy eating and exercise."

- **Reason for New Suggested Change:**
  The expert reviewer's suggestion is nearly aligned; however, it can be refined further to avoid repetition and ensure clarity.

- **New Suggested Sentence:**
  "Describe your lifestyle and how a different treatment might better suit your needs. For instance, if you travel frequently and need a convenient medication, or if you have limited time for exercise and need a treatment that supports weight management."
