## Review Based on Non-Promotional Material Guidelines

### 1. Introduction Sentence Adjustments

- **The original source sentence**: "It's important that you feel empowered and ready to talk to your doctor whenever you feel a change could be beneficial."
- **The deviation from the guidelines originally provided by the expert reviewer**: The sentence can be seen as encouraging specific actions without clear evidence or factual basis, which might be considered indirect promotion. According to [Source - EFPIA Chapter 3], Informational content should be fair, balanced, and objective.
- **The expert reviewer's original suggested change**: "It's helpful to feel informed and prepared when discussing potential changes to your treatment with your doctor so that you can collaboratively tailor your healthcare plan."
- **An explanation for the reason behind your new suggested change**: The expert's sentence still talks about "potential changes" implying some action is needed. To be more balanced and non-promotional, focusing on being informed and collaborative without hinting at change even subtly.
- **My new suggested sentence**: "It's helpful to be informed and prepared when discussing your treatment with your doctor to collaboratively tailor your healthcare plan to your needs."

### 2. Addressing Subjectivity in Patient and Doctor Roles

- **The original source sentence**: "Your doctor is the medical expert, but you are the one living with type 2 diabetes. You know your mind and body, and it's important to advocate for your needs and preferences during your discussion."
- **The deviation from the guidelines originally provided by the expert reviewer**: Some subjective elements can be viewed as speculative and suggest it is the patient's responsibility to "advocate," which could mislead or put undue pressure on them. According to [Source - Communicate With Care Pocket Guide], Stick to facts and avoid exaggerated expressions.
- **The expert reviewer's original suggested change**: "While your doctor has the medical expertise to guide your treatment, sharing your experiences can ensure your care plan aligns well with your personal health needs."
- **An explanation for the reason behind your new suggested change**: This offers a factual tone and emphasizes partnership without using promotional language or implying heavy reliance on patient advocacy.
- **My new suggested sentence**: "Your doctor has medical expertise to guide your treatment, and sharing your experiences can help ensure that your care plan matches your health needs effectively."

### 6. Lifestyle Discussion for Suitability

- **The original source sentence**: "Talk about your lifestyle and how a new treatment might be better suited for you."
- **The deviation from the guidelines originally provided by the expert reviewer**: The sentence is slightly speculative about the necessity for a new treatment. According to [Source - Communicate With Care Pocket Guide], Avoid speculation.
- **The expert reviewer's original suggested change**: "Discuss your lifestyle with your doctor to understand how your treatment can be optimized to suit your daily activities and overall health goals."
- **An explanation for the reason behind your new suggested change**: The expert's version provides a better approach but still implies the necessity of a treatment adjustment. Instead, a more neutral tone that focuses on understanding current treatment suitability is preferred.
- **My new suggested sentence**: "Discuss your lifestyle with your doctor to ensure that your treatment is suitable for your daily activities and health goals."

### 10. Reminder of Collaborative Efforts

- **The original source sentence**: "By speaking up, asking questions and being part of the decision-making process, you can create a personalized plan that'll empower you on your journey towards better health."
- **The deviation from the guidelines originally provided by the expert reviewer**: Can be perceived as encouraging independence in decision-making over professional guidance. According to [Source - EFPIA Chapter 3], HLH activities should allow diverse evidence-based science participation.
- **The expert reviewer's original suggested change**: "By actively engaging in discussions, asking questions, and being involved in the decision-making process, you and your doctor can collaboratively create a personalized treatment plan to support your health journey."
- **An explanation for the reason behind your new suggested change**: The expert's version is mostly compliant but can emphasize the collaborative nature more explicitly without hinting at personal empowerment as the primary goal.
- **My new suggested sentence**: "By actively engaging in discussions and questions with your doctor, you can collaboratively develop a personalized treatment plan to support your health goals."

By making these changes, the material aligns better with the non-promotional guidelines and maintains a professional, factual, and balanced tone, enhancing its efficacy and compliance.
