- Comment 1:
    - Original source sentence: "How to talk about treatment options"
    - Deviations: The original document lacks a clear reference to the requirement for materials to have fair, balanced, and objective content as per the "Non-Promotional Material Guidelines" from EFPIA Chapter 3.
    - Expert reviewer's original suggested change: "When discussing treatment options, it's essential to ensure that the information provided is fair, balanced, and objective, reflecting diverse evidence-based science."
    - Reason for the change: The expert reviewer's suggested change aligns with the guideline to ensure that the content is not promotional and adheres to ethical standards by emphasizing the need for fair and balanced information. However, the revised sentence could be more specific in tying back the discussion of treatment options to evidence-based science.
    - New suggested sentence: "When discussing treatment options with patients, it's crucial to present information that is not only fair, balanced, and objective, but also rooted in diverse evidence-based scientific knowledge, as outlined in the 'Non-Promotional Material Guidelines.'"

- Comment 2:
    - Original source sentence: "When you're living with type 2 diabetes, it's common to reevaluate and change your treatment to adjust to your changing personal health needs."
    - Deviations: The original document doesn't explicitly connect the educational material to unmet needs in healthcare, as required by the "Non-Promotional Material Guidelines" principles from EFPIA Chapter 3.
    - Expert reviewer's original suggested change: "Considering the evolving nature of type 2 diabetes treatment, it's crucial to engage in educational discussions that address unmet needs in healthcare."
    - Reason for the change: The expert reviewer's suggested change aligns with the guideline but could further emphasize the direct connection between educational content for patients with type 2 diabetes and addressing unmet healthcare needs more explicitly.
    - New suggested sentence: "Amid managing type 2 diabetes, exploring treatment adjustments is common to address your evolving health requirements; hence, it's crucial to engage in discussions that directly cater to unmet needs in healthcare, as specified in the 'Non-Promotional Material Guidelines.'"

- Comment 3:
    - Original source sentence: "Your doctor is the medical expert, but you are the one living with type 2 diabetes. You know your mind and body, and it's important to advocate for your needs and preferences during your discussion."
    - Deviations: The original content overlooks the requirement for LLH activities to be fair, balanced, and objective as per the "Non-Promotional Material Guidelines" outlined in EFPIA Chapter 3.
    - Expert reviewer's original suggested change: "Although your doctor holds medical expertise, your first-hand experience living with type 2 diabetes should be complemented with scientifically accurate, fair, balanced, and objective information to drive discussions and decision-making processes."
    - Reason for the change: While the expert reviewer's suggested change addresses the need for fair, balanced, and objective information, it could be improved by connecting this requirement more explicitly to the LLH activities guideline.
    - New suggested sentence: "In navigating your type 2 diabetes journey, your voice as a patient is pivotal alongside medical expertise; therefore, it's imperative to integrate scientifically accurate, fair, balanced, and objective information into discussions, aligning with the stipulations in the 'Non-Promotional Material Guidelines' from EFPIA Chapter 3."
