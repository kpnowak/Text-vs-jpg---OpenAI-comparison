**Expert Reviewer's Suggested Change:**
"This is a DRAFT, for preparatory use in NN only. Affiliates are responsible for compliance with local procedures and for review of such non-promotional material, e.g., against more stringent local legislation, and if relevant local code of conduct before distribution."

**Explanation for New Change:**
While the expert's suggestion is correct, it lacks a note for confidentiality when relevant and instructions for final documents.

**New Suggested Sentence:**
"This material is for preparatory use in NN only. Affiliates are responsible for ensuring compliance with local procedures and reviewing this non-promotional material against more stringent local legislation and relevant codes of conduct before distribution. Mark as 'DRAFT' if not final and/or 'CONFIDENTIAL' if required."
