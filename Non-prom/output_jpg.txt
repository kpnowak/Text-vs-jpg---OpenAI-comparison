1. **Original Source Sentence:** "Share your personal goals, whether it’s better blood sugar control, weight management, or reducing the risk of cardiovascular events, and discuss with your doctor how your current treatment could be more effective."
   - **Deviation Identified:** Overemphasis on treatment effectiveness, which might imply promotional intent.
     - **Source and Key Point:** According to [Source - EFPIA Chapter 3, Article 17, key point iii]: “The nature of Informational or Educational Materials and Items of Medical Utility considered may not constitute a circumvention of the prohibition on gifts defined under Article 11 of this Code."

This information is intended for diabetes patients who have been prescribed a medicinal product and should not be substituted for medical advice from your doctor."
