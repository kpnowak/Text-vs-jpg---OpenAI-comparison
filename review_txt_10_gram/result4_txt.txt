I have reviewed the document provided focusing on correcting grammatical errors in the English language. Below are the corrections made:

1. "He study english with me at university."
   - The deviation corrected: Subject-verb agreement error ("study" should be changed to "studies").
   - The reason for the correction: To ensure subject-verb agreement.
   - Your new sentence: He studies English with me at university.

2. "He didn 't making the first move to go and see her."
   - The deviation corrected: Incorrect verb form ("making" should be "make").
   - The reason for the correction: To ensure correct verb usage.
   - Your new sentence: He didn't make the first move to go and see her.

3. "He taked a drink to get some energy and after a few minutes of endless hesitation, he walked to her."
   - The deviation corrected: Incorrect verb form ("taked" should be "took").
   - The reason for the correction: To ensure correct past tense form.
   - Your new sentence: He took a drink to get some energy, and after a few minutes of endless hesitation, he walked to her.

4. "Feeling reassured and confident, he told her which feelings he was experiencing."
   - The deviation corrected: Awkward phrasing ("which feelings" should be "what feelings").
   - The reason for the correction: To improve clarity and naturalness of expression.
   - Your new sentence: Feeling reassured and confident, he told her what feelings he was experiencing.

5. "She could hardly say a word but after a little seconds, she said : ' I' m sorry to deceive you but actually I fancy Sebastian '."
   - The deviation corrected: Inaccurate phrasing ("after a little seconds" should be "after a few seconds").
   - The reason for the correction: To use the correct phrase for expressing a short amount of time.
   - Your new sentence: She could hardly say a word but after a few seconds, she said, "I'm sorry to deceive you but actually I fancy Sebastian."

Please let me know if further revisions or clarifications are needed.
