I will carefully review the document to correct any grammatical errors. Let's start with the first sentence:

"Yesterday, I gone to a party with my friend David."
The deviation corrected: Corrected the verb to match the grammatical rule (went instead of gone).
Reason for correction: "Gone" is not the correct past tense form of "go"; it should be replaced with "went" for proper grammar.
The revised sentence: "Yesterday, I went to a party with my friend David."

Moving on to the next sentence:

"He didn 't making the first move to go and see her."
The deviation corrected: Corrected the verb form to match the correct structure (making -> make).
Reason for correction: There was an error in verb form, and it should be corrected for grammatical accuracy.
The revised sentence: "He didn't make the first move to go and see her."

Please let me know if you would like me to continue reviewing the document sentence by sentence.
