Based on the guidelines provided, I will now review the expert reviewer's comments systematically:

**Expert Reviewer's Comment:**
"The patient were given two doses of the medication."

**Deviation from Guidelines:**
Inconsistent verb tense usage.

**Expert Reviewer's Suggested Change:**
"The patient were given two doses of the medication."

**Reason for New Suggested Change:**
The verb "were" should be corrected to "was" to maintain consistency in verb tense usage.

**New Suggested Sentence:**
"The patient was given two doses of the medication."

This correction adheres to the guidelines and ensures consistency in verb tense usage.
