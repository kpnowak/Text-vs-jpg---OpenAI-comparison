### Review of Document: "How to talk about treatment options"

#### Section 1: Introduction
**Source Sentence:** “It can be difficult to start these conversations, but with your treatment goals in mind—and by educating yourself more about type 2 diabetes (like you’re doing right now!)—you’ll be able to communicate with your doctor more openly about treatment.”

**Deviation:** The sentence contains an informal tone and encourages self-education in a promotional manner.

**Guideline Source:** [Source - Communicate With Care Pocket Guide: Article 2 - Be Clear and Professional, ii. Assess Document Sensitivity: Evaluate if the content should be shared or discussed in a less permanent form, like verbally.]

**New Sentence:** "While these discussions might be challenging, keeping your treatment goals in focus and being well-informed about type 2 diabetes can enhance your communication with your doctor regarding treatment options."

**Reason for Change:** This resolves the deviation by maintaining a professional tone and providing clear, factual information without promotional language.

**Source Sentence:** “Talk about your lifestyle and how a new treatment might be better suited for you.

**Deviation:** The sentence suggests preference for new treatment options, which can be perceived as promotional.

**Guideline Source:** [Source - EFPIA Chapter 3, Article 17 - Informational or Educational Materials and Items of Medical Utility, iii: The nature of Informational or Educational Materials and Items of Medical Utility considered may not constitute a circumvention of the prohibition on gifts defined under Article 11 of this Code.]
