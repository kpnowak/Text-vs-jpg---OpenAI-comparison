### Review Points:

#### 1. Clarity and Sensitivity:
**Original Source Sentence:** "When you’re living with type 2 diabetes, it’s common to reevaluate and change your treatment to adjust to your changing personal health needs."

**Deviation from Guidelines:** The original sentence could be interpreted as direct medical advice, which is discouraged under the "Communicate With Care Pocket Guide" as it might have legal implications and lacks clarity, potentially leading to misinterpretation.

**Expert Reviewer's Suggested Change:** "When living with type 2 diabetes, it's important to regularly consult with your doctor to discuss if any adjustments to your treatment plan are needed to address your changing personal health needs."

**Explanation for New Change:** The suggested sentence by the expert is well-structured and aligns with the guidelines. However, it can be made slightly more concise while still maintaining the emphasis on consulting a healthcare provider.

According to [Source - Communicate With Care Pocket Guide], information should consider legal implications and maintain clarity to avoid misinterpretation. The revised sentence reinforces doctor consultation without implying direct medical advice.

#### 2. Avoiding Exaggeration and Speculation:
**Original Source Sentence:** "Educating yourself more about type 2 diabetes (like you’re doing right now!)—you’ll be able to communicate with your doctor more openly about treatment."

**Deviation from Guidelines:** The phrase "like you’re doing right now!" is informal and exaggerative, which is not in alignment with the "Communicate With Care Pocket Guide" that calls for a professional tone and avoiding speculation.

**Expert Reviewer's Suggested Change:** "By educating yourself more about type 2 diabetes, you will be better equipped to communicate with your doctor about your treatment options."

**Explanation for New Change:** The expert’s suggestion is appropriate but could be made slightly more succinct to enhance clarity.

#### 3. Compliance with Informational Materials Guideline:
**Original Source Sentence:** "Share your personal goals, whether it’s better blood sugar control, weight management, or reducing the risk of cardiovascular events, and discuss with your doctor how your current treatment could be more effective."

**Deviation from Guidelines:** The original sentence may imply a promotion of treatment changes rather than focusing purely on educational aspects, breaching EFPIA Chapter 3, Article 17.

**Expert Reviewer's Suggested Change:** "Discuss your personal goals with your doctor, such as better blood sugar control, weight management, or reducing the risk of cardiovascular events and assess together how these goals could be achieved effectively."

**Explanation for New Change:** This recommendation adheres well to the guidelines; it maintains a neutral tone and emphasizes collaboration.

**New Suggested Sentence:** [No significant changes needed]

According to [Source - EFPIA Chapter 3, Article 17], materials must not constitute promotion and should remain educational. The suggested change meets these requirements by focusing on collaborative discussions.

#### 4. Content Balance and Objectivity:
**Original Source Sentence:** "If the cost is too high—and ask if there might find a better alternative that addresses these challenges."

**Deviation from Guidelines:** The original sentence might provoke a biased discussion on cost-related issues, breaching EFPIA Chapter 3, Article 16’s requirement for balanced and objective content.

**Expert Reviewer's Suggested Change:** "If cost is a concern, discuss with your doctor to explore all available treatment options that address these challenges effectively."

**Explanation for New Change:** The expert reviewer's change can be enhanced slightly to add more structure to the sentence for better readability.

**New Suggested Sentence:** "If cost concerns arise, consult your doctor to explore all available treatment options that effectively address these challenges."

According to [Source - EFPIA Chapter 3, Article 16], content must be fair, balanced, and objective. The revised sentence avoids suggesting any particular solution and supports comprehensive discussion with a healthcare provider.

#### 7. Encouraging Patient-Doctor Collaboration:
**Original Source Sentence:** "By speaking up, asking questions, and being part of the decision-making process, you can create a personalized plan that’ll empower you on your journey towards better health."

**Deviation from Guidelines:** The original sentence may appear less formal and overly promotive without emphasizing sufficient collaborative nature, which goes against the "Communicate With Care Pocket Guide" principles of maintaining a professional tone and clear communication.
