Below are the improvements I have made based on the expert reviews and the "Non-Promotional Material Guidelines":

### Comment 1
**The original source sentence**: N/A (additional disclaimer needed)

**The deviation from the guidelines originally provided by the expert reviewer**: Missing disclaimer

**The expert reviewer's original suggested change**:
"The image shown is a model and not a real patient. The character and its description are for representation purposes only and do not reflect real patient experiences."

**An explanation for the reason behind your new suggested change**:
The expert's addition of disclaimers is correct, but this can be improved for clarity and consistency with the guidelines.

**Your new suggested sentence**:
"The images and characters depicted are models and not real patients, and their descriptions are for representation purposes only."

**Deviations**:
According to [Source - Disclaimer Texts for Non-promotional Material], it is important to ensure that general disclaimers clarify the nature of the images and advice.

### Comment 3
**The original source sentence**:
"Talk about your lifestyle and how a new treatment might be better suited for you."

**The deviation from the guidelines originally provided by the expert reviewer**: Does not provide medical utility directly relevant to patient care.

**The expert reviewer's original suggested change**:
"Discuss how your day-to-day lifestyle—including work, exercise, and diet—might be impacted by current or new treatment options."

**An explanation for the reason behind your new suggested change**:
The expert's suggested change is good but can be further detailed for better alignment with the guideline’s intent.

**Your new suggested sentence**:
"Discuss how your daily activities, including work, exercise, and diet, may be influenced by your current treatment or new treatment options that may better fit your lifestyle."

**Deviations**:
According to [Source - EFPIA Chapter 3: Article 17], educational and informational materials provided should be directly relevant to the practice of medicine and beneficial to patient care.

### Comment 5
**The original source sentence**: N/A (additional disclaimer needed)

**The deviation from the guidelines originally provided by the expert reviewer**: Need for internal communication disclaimer.

**The expert reviewer's original suggested change**:
"This material is for preparatory use in NN only. DRAFT."

**An explanation for the reason behind your new suggested change**:
The expert's addition of disclaimers is correct but can be improved for clarity and consistency with the guidelines.
