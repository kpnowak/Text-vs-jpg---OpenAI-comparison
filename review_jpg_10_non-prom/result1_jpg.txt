## Review of the Document

### Observation 1
#### Original Sentence
"When you’re living with type 2 diabetes, it’s common to reevaluate and change your treatment to adjust to your changing personal health needs."
#### Deviation
According to [Source - Communicate With Care Pocket Guide], the guideline emphasizes the importance of maintaining professional tone and providing clarity to prevent misunderstandings. The current phrase “it’s common to reevaluate and change” could be made more precise and professional.
#### New Sentence
"When you’re living with type 2 diabetes, it’s often necessary to reevaluate and modify your treatment to better align with your evolving personal health needs."
#### Reason and Resolution
This revised sentence enhances professionalism and clarity by replacing "common" with "often necessary" and "change” with “modify." This ensures the communication is clear and considerate.

### Observation 2
#### Original Sentence
"It can be difficult to start these conversations, but with your treatment goals in mind—and by educating yourself more about type 2 diabetes (like you’re doing right now!)—you’ll be able to communicate with your doctor more openly about treatment."
#### Deviation
According to [Source - Communicate With Care Pocket Guide], avoid sarcasm and humor to ensure a professional tone. The phrase “like you’re doing right now!” may come across as colloquial and should be revised.
#### New Sentence
"It can be challenging to initiate these discussions, but with a clear understanding of your treatment goals and an informed perspective on type 2 diabetes, you’ll be better equipped to have open conversations with your doctor about treatment options."
#### Reason and Resolution
This sentence maintains a professional tone and removes informal language, aligning with the guideline to ensure clarity and professionalism.

### Observation 3
#### Original Sentence
"Discuss any difficulties you’ve experienced with your current treatment—such as side effects, if you would prefer a pill or an injection (if the option is available), if it fits into your lifestyle, if the cost is too high—and ask if there might find a better alternative that addresses these challenges."
#### Deviation
According to [Source - Communicate With Care Pocket Guide], ensuring clarity to prevent misunderstandings is essential. The usage of multiple clauses within parentheses may be confusing for the reader.
#### New Sentence
"Discuss any difficulties you’ve experienced with your current treatment, such as side effects. Inform your doctor if you would prefer a pill or an injection (if available), if it fits into your lifestyle, or if the cost is prohibitive, and inquire if there might be a better alternative to address these challenges."
#### Reason and Resolution
This sentence splits complex ideas into simpler ones, making it clearer and easier to understand, thus enhancing communication and clarity.

### Observation 4
#### Original Sentence
"Talk about your lifestyle and how a new treatment might be better suited for you. For example, if you travel a lot for work and are looking for a medication that is easy to take or maybe you don’t have time to exercise as much as you would like, and you would prefer a treatment that can support your weight management goals (in addition to healthy eating and exercise)."
#### Deviation
According to [Source - Communicate With Care Pocket Guide], providing clear context is critical. The parenthetical remark makes the sentence unnecessarily complex.
#### New Sentence
"Discuss your lifestyle with your doctor and how a new treatment might be better suited for you. For example, if you travel frequently for work and need a medication that is easy to take, or if you have limited time for exercise and require a treatment that can help support your weight management goals in conjunction with healthy eating and exercise."

By removing the parenthetical remark and restructuring the sentence, the revised version is clearer and more reader-friendly, in line with providing clear and professional communication.
