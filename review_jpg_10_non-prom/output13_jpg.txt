### Section: Body Content (Introduction)
**Original Sentence:**
"When you’re living with type 2 diabetes, it’s common to reevaluate and change your treatment to adjust to your changing personal health needs."

**Deviation:**
- Not explicitly presenting facts without implying specific treatment changes which may border on promotion.
- Should be non-promotional and directly educational.
- According to [Source - EFPIA Chapter 3: Article 16], the content must avoid promotional intent and focus on educational aspects.

**Expert Reviewer's Original Suggested Change:**
"Living with type 2 diabetes requires regular reassessment of your treatment plans to better address your evolving healthcare needs."

**Explanation for New Change:**
The original suggested change could still imply a reassessment of treatment plans. To maintain a purely educational tone without implying treatment changes, it’s important to focus on general health management.

**New Suggested Sentence:**
"Living with type 2 diabetes involves regular evaluations of your health to address your evolving healthcare needs."

### Section: Body Content (Empowerment)
**Original Sentence:**
"It’s important that you feel empowered and ready to talk to your doctor whenever you feel a change could be beneficial."

**Deviation:**
- Could unintentionally imply encouragement for a change in treatment which could be seen as indirect promotion.
- According to [Source - EFPIA Chapter 3: Article 20], content must focus on communication without suggesting treatment adjustments.

**Expert Reviewer's Original Suggested Change:**
"It’s important to feel confident and prepared to discuss your healthcare needs with your doctor."

**Explanation for New Change:**
The expert’s change is almost adequate but the phrase “discuss your healthcare needs” can still be more general. Emphasizing the aspect of communication without hinting at treatment changes is crucial.

**New Suggested Sentence:**
"It’s important to feel empowered and ready to discuss your health with your doctor."

### Section: Personal Goals
**Original Sentence:**
"Share your personal goals, whether it’s better blood sugar control, weight management, or reducing the risk of cardiovascular events, and discuss with your doctor how your current treatment could be more effective."

**Deviation:**
- Explicit mention of treatment efficacy bordering promotional tone needs adjustment.
- According to [Source - EFPIA Chapter 3: Article 17 (ii)], informational material should directly benefit patient care without implying changes in treatment effectiveness.

**Expert Reviewer's Original Suggested Change:**
"Discuss your personal health goals such as better blood sugar control, weight management, or reducing the risk of cardiovascular events with your doctor to understand the best approaches to manage these goals."

**Explanation for New Change:**
While the expert’s suggestion moves towards a more educational tone, it still needs refinement to avoid the implication of treatment effectiveness completely.

**New Suggested Sentence:**
"Discuss your personal health goals, including better blood sugar control, weight management, or reducing the risk of cardiovascular events with your doctor to explore various management strategies."

### Section: Challenges
**Original Sentence:**
"Discuss any difficulties you’ve experienced with your current treatment—such as side effects, if you would prefer a pill or an injection (if the option is available), if it fits into your lifestyle, if the cost is too high—and ask if there might find a better alternative that addresses these challenges."

**Deviation:**
- Possibly suggesting alternatives, verging on treatment promotional suggestions.
- According to [Source - EFPIA Chapter 3: Article 16], addressing difficulties should not imply seeking different treatment options.

**Expert Reviewer's Original Suggested Change:**
"Discuss any difficulties experienced with your current treatment, such as side effects, administration preferences, lifestyle compatibility, or cost considerations, and seek professional advice on managing these challenges."

**Explanation for New Change:**
The expert reviewer’s suggestion is good but can be improved by focusing more on managing challenges rather than referring too specifically to treatment alternatives.

**New Suggested Sentence:**
"Talk to your doctor about any difficulties with your current treatment, such as side effects, administration preferences, lifestyle compatibility, or cost, to find ways to manage these issues."
